This project is a complete analytics done using Python and Tableau. Here, i have used Python to scrap the raw data from the website followed by which i used Excel to filter down and clean the data since it had alot of inconsistencies. 
Followed by that, i used Tableau for the entire analysis and to display important features of Premier league 2023-24 season.
